# Coffee-Machine-Simulator
This project simulates a coffee machine using Python. It allows users to choose between espresso, latte, and cappuccino, insert virtual coins, and get feedback on whether they have inserted enough money and whether the machine has enough resources to make the drink. The machine also provides change when needed and keeps track of available resources and revenue.
